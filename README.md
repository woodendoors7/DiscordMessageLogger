Discord Message Logger is a Discord.JS self bot that logs deleted messages of servers you are in.

# BIG PLANS!

We are currently working on giving the app an UI and trying to switch from Discord.js to coding a web socket connection ourselves.

## How to use

**Installation:**
Make sure that you have [NODE.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer.

Run the `SETUP.bat` file, or type these commands line by line in Command Prompt (CMD):
```
npm install discord.js
npm install discord.js-self
npm install xmlhttprequest
```
**Set up:** Open the `Settings and database` folder. Open the file `SETTINGS.json` in a text editor, preferably a text editor designed to edit JSON.

1. Put your discord token into the `token` part in the JSON. ([how to get your discord token]())
2. Whitelist the servers that you want to log by copying their IDs and putting them into `serverWhitelist`. You can add more lines, make sure each is separated by a comma
3. Put the ID of the channel you want to log the messages in into `logsChannelID`. Make sure that it is a private server, otherwise, someone might report you for breaking TOS


**Starting:** Open the `START.bat` file, or type `node index.js` in cmd. Wait for it to load your settings and log on, this can take a minute. Once It's logged in, you can try it.
